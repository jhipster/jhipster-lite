## Description

JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop & deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures.

**JHipster Lite** will help you to start your project, by generating step by step only what you need.

The goal is:

- you will only generate the code you want
- the generated code uses Hexagonal Architecture
- best quality as possible: 💯% coverage, 0 code smell, no duplication 😎

## Prerequisites

### Java

You need to have Java 17 :

- [JDK 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)

### Node.js and NPM

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): we use Node to run a development web server and build the project. Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.

```
npm ci
```

You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

## Test the project

To launch tests:

```
./mvnw clean test
```

To launch tests and integration tests:

```
./mvnw clean verify
```

To launch local Sonar Analysis:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Then:

```
./mvnw clean verify sonar:sonar
```

To check format, using prettier:

```
npm run prettier:check
```

To launch format all code with prettier:

```
npm run prettier:format
```

## Run the project

You can run the project using Maven, as `spring-boot:run` is the default target:

```
./mvnw
```

Or, first, you can package as jar:

```
./mvnw package
```

Then, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:7471/swagger-ui.html in your browser.

## Generate your project

Go to http://localhost:7471/swagger-ui.html and build your own JSON to generate a project. Here an example:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```yaml
{
  "folder": "/tmp/beer",
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "baseName": "beer",
    "projectName": "Beer Project",
    "packageName": "tech.jhipster.beer",
    "serverPort": 8080
  }
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

You can use the different existing APIs to:

- init the project

Then, for a Java project, you can add:

- Maven as Build Tool
- Java Base classes and Domain Error

List of optional tools for Java:

- ArchUnit tests
- JaCoCo configuration for minimum coverage
- Sonar configuration

Setup:

- GitHub Codespaces

Spring Boot:

- Spring Boot as Server Framework
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Tomcat or Undertow as Spring Boot MVC
  - Spring Security with JWT
    - Basic Auth
  - OAuth 2.0 and OIDC Authentication
- AOP Logging
- Asynchronous execution and scheduling configuration
- Spring Cache
  - Simple
  - Ehcache
- Developer Tools
- Logstash TCP appender
- Springdoc without or with Security JWT
- Jib to build Docker image

Spring Boot Database:

- PostgreSQL, MySQL or MariaDB as Database
  - Liquibase or Flyway as Database Migration Tool
  - User and Authority tables (depending on Liquibase or Flyway)
- MongoDB as NoSQL Database

Spring Cloud:

- Eureka client
- Spring Cloud Config client
- Spring Cloud Consul

Client:

- Angular
- React with Vite
- Vue with Vite
