## Description

JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop & deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures.

**JHipster Lite** will help you to start your project, by generating step by step only what you need.

- the generated code uses Hexagonal Architecture
- the technical code is separated from your business code
- you will only generate the code you want, no additional unused code
- best quality as possible: 💯% coverage, 0 code smell, no duplication 😎

## Deploy to Heroku

Click this button to deploy your own instance of the registry:
[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/matthieulapatate/jhipster-lite/tree/HerokuDeployment)

Complementary informations:

- You will have the latest release behaviour on that server
- This will allow you to not be obliged to install all dependencies needed for launching the jhipster-lite project
- The registry service cannot be scaled up to multiple dynos to provide redundancy. You must deploy multiple applications (i.e. click the button more than once). This is because Eureka requires distinct URLs to synchronize in-memory state between instances.

## Prerequisites

### Java

You need to have Java 17 :

- [JDK 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)

### Node.js and NPM

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): we use Node to run a development web server and build the project. Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.

```
npm ci
```

You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

## Test the project

To launch tests:

```
./mvnw clean test
```

To launch tests and integration tests:

```
./mvnw clean verify
```

## Prettier

We use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and [prettier-java](https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java) to format our code.

To check format:

```
npm run prettier:check
```

To launch format all code:

```
npm run prettier:format
```

## Sonar Analysis

To launch local Sonar Analysis:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Then:

```
./mvnw clean verify sonar:sonar
```

So you can check the result at http://localhost:9001

## Run the project

You can run the project using Maven, as `spring-boot:run` is the default target:

```
./mvnw
```

Or, first, you can package as jar:

```
./mvnw package
```

Then, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:7471/swagger-ui.html in your browser.

## e2e tests

You need to run the project first. Then, you can run the end-to-end tests:

```
npm run e2e
```

Or in headless mode:

```
npm run e2e:headless
```

## Generate your project

Go to http://localhost:7471/swagger-ui.html and build your own JSON to generate a project. Here an example:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```yaml
{
  "folder": "/tmp/beer",
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "baseName": "beer",
    "projectName": "Beer Project",
    "packageName": "tech.jhipster.beer",
    "serverPort": 8080
  }
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

You can use the different existing APIs to:

- init the project

Then, for a Java project, you can add:

- Maven as Build Tool
- Java Base classes and Domain Error

List of optional tools for Java:

- ArchUnit tests
- JaCoCo configuration for minimum coverage
- Sonar configuration

Setup:

- GitHub Codespaces

Spring Boot:

- Spring Boot as Server Framework
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Tomcat or Undertow as Spring Boot MVC
  - Spring Security with JWT
    - Basic Auth
  - OAuth 2.0 and OIDC Authentication
- AOP Logging
- Asynchronous execution and scheduling configuration
- Spring Cache
  - Simple
  - Ehcache
- Developer Tools
- Logstash TCP appender
- Springdoc without or with Security JWT
- Jib to build Docker image

Spring Boot Database:

- PostgreSQL, MySQL or MariaDB as Database
  - Liquibase or Flyway as Database Migration Tool
  - User and Authority tables (depending on Liquibase or Flyway)
- MongoDB as NoSQL Database

Spring Cloud:

- Eureka client
- Spring Cloud Config client
- Spring Cloud Consul

Broker:

- Apache Kafka

Client:

- Angular
- React with Vite
- Vue with Vite

Continuous Integration:

- GitHub Actions
